# Fidget Spinner

Fidget Spinner is web service that akin to a real fidget spinners doesn't do any
useful work.

It has a single endpoint `GET /spin` which "spins" CPU for a bit faking useful
work. See it's [OpenAPI doc][oapi].

As surprising as this might be this service has it's uses. It's raison d'Ãªtre is
testing of both Kubernetes [horizontal pod autoscaling][hpa] and [cluster
capacity autoscaling][ca] and their behavior under various conditions. More
specifically CPU utilization or RPS based autoscaling.
